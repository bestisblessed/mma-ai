Based on the comprehensive analysis of both fighters' statistics and historical performances, the fight between Charlie 'Chuck Buffalo' Radtke and Carlos 'Carlao' Prates is likely to be highly competitive with contrasting strategies. Radtke will use his tactical prowess and endurance to withstand the initial assault from Prates, who will look for an early knockout. If Radtke can effectively navigate through the early danger, his chances to take control in the later rounds increase significantly. Therefore, I predict that Charlie 'Chuck Buffalo' Radtke will win by decision after a full five rounds, utilizing his superior endurance and strategic fighting to outlast Carlos 'Carlao' Prates.
