Based on the comprehensive analysis of both fighters' statistics and historical performances, Miguel 'Caramel Thunder' Baeza appears to have a slight advantage due to his higher strike rate and proven ability to perform under pressure. Punahele 'Story Time' Soriano, while possessing knockout power, shows potential vulnerability in longer bouts which can be critical in a fight against a well-rounded opponent like Baeza. Predicting the outcome, I foresee Miguel Baeza winning by TKO in the third round, as his endurance and strategic striking could capitalize on Soriano's decreased performance in the later rounds of the fight.
