Carlos 'Carlao' Prates is a well-rounded MMA fighter with a professional record of 18 wins (13 by knockout/technical knockout, 3 by submission), 6 losses, and no draws. His significant strike accuracy is recorded at 56%, and he maintains a striking defense of 37%. Prates' proficiency in both striking and grappling positions him as a formidable opponent in the welterweight division.

Prates' recent performances indicate a heavy reliance on his striking capabilities, often utilizing his power to dominate his opponents. His strike intake per minute (SApM) is relatively high at 5.95, which suggests that while he is aggressive in his approach, this also makes him vulnerable to fighters who can maintain a high volume of accurate strikes. His defensive stats, particularly a striking defense of 37%, further highlight potential areas that opponents like Radtke could exploit.

Given Radtke’s recent performance showing a strong tactical striking approach and his ability to maintain stamina throughout the rounds, he might pose a significant challenge to Prates. Radtke’s strategy could effectively take advantage of Prates' defensive gaps, focusing on delivering a high volume of strikes while managing the pressure from Prates' aggressive counterattacks.

Prates' ground game, albeit less frequently showcased, includes successful takedowns and submission attempts, suggesting that he is capable of shifting the dynamics of the fight if taken to the ground. This aspect of his skill set should not be underestimated, as it could serve as a critical factor in countering Radtke’s striking-focused strategy.

Overall, Carlos 'Carlao' Prates' fighting style is marked by aggressive striking and effective use of his power. However, his high strike intake and lower defensive metrics could be areas of concern against a strategically sound and endurance-focused fighter like Charlie 'Chuck Buffalo' Radtke. The upcoming match promises to be a compelling clash of tactics and endurance in the welterweight division.
