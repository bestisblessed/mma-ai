Charlie 'Chuck Buffalo' Radtke has shown consistent performance in his recent fights, maintaining a record of 9 wins and 3 losses. His last two recorded fights both ended in unanimous decisions, indicating his ability to maintain stamina and effectiveness through all rounds. Radtke's striking accuracy and approach in these fights, especially against Blood Diamond (44 of 94 significant strikes), suggest a calculated striking game, which could be crucial against a fighter like Carlos Prates, who has a high strike intake (SApM of 5.95) but lower defensive metrics (37% striking defense).

Against Prates, Radtke's strategy might benefit from exploiting the defensive gaps in Prates' game, focusing on maintaining a high volume of accurate strikes while avoiding Prates' powerful counter-strikes. The upcoming fight's outcome will heavily depend on Radtke's ability to manage the pressure from Prates' aggressive striking and possibly look for opportunities to take the fight to the ground, given Prates' mixed results in submission scenarios.

Overall, Radtke's current momentum, derived from his recent unanimous decision wins and his capability to contend in prolonged bouts, positions him as a formidable opponent for Prates. His tactical striking and endurance could very well leverage Prates' defensive weaknesses, making this an intriguing matchup in the welterweight division.
