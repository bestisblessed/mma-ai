Dominick 'The Devastator' Reyes has a professional MMA record of 12 wins and 4 losses. His fight statistics include a Significant Strikes per Minute (SLpM) of 4.75, a striking accuracy of 50%, he absorbs 3.77 strikes per minute (SApM), and has a striking defense of 48%.

Recent fight analysis reveals that Reyes last fought against Ryan Spann on November 12, 2022, at UFC 281 in New York, where he faced a loss. Before this, he had a series of challenging fights, including a notable fight against Jiri Prochazka on May 1, 2021, at UFC on ESPN 23, where he was knocked out in the second round. His fight history shows a four-fight losing streak since 2019, indicating a significant momentum shift from his earlier career where he had an undefeated streak of 12-0.

Reyes' performance has shown vulnerabilities in his defense, particularly against fighters with strong striking skills, similar to Dustin Jacoby's style, who is known for his powerful striking and ability to finish fights early. The comparison with Jacoby, who has a record of multiple first-round knockouts, suggests that Reyes might struggle against fighters who can capitalize on his lower striking defense and higher strikes absorbed per minute.

In conclusion, Dominick Reyes has demonstrated formidable skills but his recent performances indicate a decline in momentum, facing difficulties against strikers with aggressive offensive tactics. His upcoming fights will be crucial for him to adapt and potentially recalibrate his strategy to regain his earlier form.
