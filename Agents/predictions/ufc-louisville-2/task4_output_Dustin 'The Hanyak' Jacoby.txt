Dustin Jacoby, known as "The Hanyak", holds a professional MMA record of 19 wins, 8 losses, and 1 draw. His record reflects a strong inclination towards striking, with 12 of his 19 wins coming by way of knockout. Jacoby's recent performance metrics show a Significant Strikes per Minute (SLpM) of 5.53, a striking accuracy of 47%, he absorbs 4.07 strikes per minute (SApM), and has a striking defense of 57%. 

Comparing these statistics with Dominick Reyes, who has a SLpM of 4.75, striking accuracy of 50%, SApM of 3.77, and striking defense of 48%, we see that Jacoby outperforms Reyes in terms of strike volume and defensive capabilities, although he is slightly less accurate and absorbs more strikes per minute. This suggests that while Jacoby is more aggressive and effective in his defense, his fighting style also exposes him to more incoming strikes.

Jacoby's recent fight history includes a loss by unanimous decision against Azamat Murzakanov on April 15, 2023, at UFC on ESPN 44, indicating a challenge in fights where he might be matched in or outperformed in technical striking or strategy.

In conclusion, Dustin "The Hanyak" Jacoby demonstrates a robust striking capability with a decent defensive skill set, making him a formidable opponent in the Light Heavyweight division. His approach to maintaining a higher offensive output could be key in matchups against similar opponents like Dominick Reyes, although his tendency to absorb more strikes can be a critical vulnerability against precision strikers. Jacoby's upcoming fights should be pivotal in determining his ability to adjust and leverage his strengths against high-caliber opponents.
