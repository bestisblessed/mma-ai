Based on the detailed statistical analysis, fight history, and current performance trends of both fighters, I predict that Raul 'El Nino Problema' Rosas Jr. will win the fight against Ricky 'Pretty' Turcios. The victory is likely to come through submission, capitalizing on his grappling strength, in the second round. This result hinges on Rosas Jr.'s ability to successfully take the fight to the ground and control the pace and position, overcoming Turcios' striking skills and experience.
