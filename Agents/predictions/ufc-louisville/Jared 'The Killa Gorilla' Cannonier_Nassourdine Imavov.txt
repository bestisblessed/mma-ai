In the upcoming UFC fight between Jared 'The Killa Gorilla' Cannonier and Nassourdine Imavov, the fight is expected to be intensely competitive, reflecting both fighters' capabilities and current form. Cannonier, with his experience and powerful striking, poses a significant threat, especially if he can leverage his strength and land significant strikes. Imavov, on the other hand, has a slight edge in striking accuracy and a notable defensive prowess, which could help him in weathering Cannonierâ€™s aggressive style and capitalizing on counter-striking opportunities.

Considering the analysis of their recent performances and the public sentiment, the fight might lean slightly towards Imavov due to his superior defensive skills and lower strike absorption rate, which are critical in a fight against a powerful striker like Cannonier. Imavov's ability to maintain distance and control the pace could frustrate Cannonier and allow Imavov to score points over time or find a critical opening.

Prediction: Nassourdine Imavov wins by decision after a closely contested battle that goes the distance, leveraging his defensive skills and tactical acumen to outscore Cannonier on the judges' scorecards. The fight is likely to extend into the later rounds, with both fighters having moments of dominance, but Imavov's consistent performance and strategic fighting style will ultimately sway the decision in his favor.
