Based on the detailed statistics and historical performance data, Ludovit Klein appears to have a significant advantage in striking with a higher accuracy and better takedown defense, which will likely allow him to control the fight when standing. Thiago Moises, although strong in grappling, may struggle to effectively manage Klein's superior striking and high takedown defense rate. Given the dynamics of their strengths and weaknesses, it is predicted that Ludovit Klein will likely win by TKO in the second round. Klein's ability to maintain the fight in a standing position and utilize his striking skills will play a crucial role in overcoming Moisesâ€™ attempts to bring the fight to the ground.
