**Fight Prediction: Hyun Sung Park vs. Carlos Hernandez**

**Prediction:** Hyun Sung Park by unanimous decision.

**Reasoning:**
Hyun Sung Park, with his undefeated record (9-0) and a well-rounded skill set, stands as a formidable opponent for Carlos Hernandez. Park's ability to finish fights with both knockouts (4 KOs) and submissions (4 submissions) showcases his versatility and finishing capability, making him a constant threat in the octagon. His balanced approach allows him to adapt to various opponents, utilizing striking and grappling effectively. 

In contrast, Carlos Hernandez holds a professional record of 10 wins and 4 losses, with most of his victories coming via decisions (6) and submissions (4). While his grappling skills are commendable, he has shown vulnerability in matchups where strikers put him under pressure. Hernandez’s striking defense has been criticized, evidenced by his knockout loss, suggesting that he could struggle significantly against Park, who is adept at striking and can capitalize on openings.

Public sentiment and betting odds heavily favor Park, indicating widespread confidence in his abilities. Park is currently listed at a -170 favorite, while Hernandez is a +150 underdog. The public opinion reflects Park’s strong grappling defense, superior striking technique, and extensive experience without any losses.

As the fight progresses, Park is likely to utilize his height (5'7" vs. Hernandez’s 5'5") and reach advantage effectively. Although Hernandez has shown resilience and cardio, he may find it challenging to deal with Park's pace and striking combinations. Park's capacity to defend against submissions will be critical in negating Hernandez's grappling threats.

Given these factors, I predict Park will outstrike Hernandez over three rounds, displaying superior technical skills while avoiding grappling exchanges as necessary. Park will likely secure a victory by unanimous decision, given his high output, effective striking, and ability to maintain distance throughout the bout. This prediction is bolstered by Park's recent unbeaten streak and strong performance history, positioning him favorably while highlighting Hernandez's potential vulnerabilities.
