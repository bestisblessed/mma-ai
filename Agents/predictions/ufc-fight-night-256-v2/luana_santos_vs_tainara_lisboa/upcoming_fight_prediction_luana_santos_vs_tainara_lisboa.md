In the upcoming fight on May 17, 2025, between Luana Santos and Tainara Lisboa, my prediction is that Tainara Lisboa will win by decision. Analyzing both fighters' records, recent performances, public sentiment, and betting odds, Lisboa's striking advantage and current 5-fight winning streak position her favorably against Santos, who has shown vulnerabilities in her recent grappling defenses.
