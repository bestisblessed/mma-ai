The upcoming fight between Gabriel Green and Matheus Camilo is shaping up to be an interesting matchup, particularly given the contrasting experiences of the fighters. 

Gabriel Green, nicknamed 'Gifted', brings a noteworthy fight record of 11 wins and 5 losses to the octagon. His experience includes 4 knockout victories and a remarkable 6 wins via submission, demonstrating his wrestling and grappling skills, which have proven decisive in past fights. Green’s ability to finish fights on the ground, particularly through submissions, gives him a strategic advantage; he can potentially take control on the mat, exploiting any weaknesses in Camilo’s defense. The notable victories he holds further solidify his credentials, especially his technical submission victories indicating a complex and effective grappling game.

On the other hand, Matheus Camilo, also known as 'Jaguar', enters this fight with a record of 9 wins against 2 losses. Although he has impressive knockout power, with 4 of his wins coming by way of KO/TKO, he is making his UFC debut which can be a significant factor. Debuting in the UFC is daunting for many, as the stage is much larger with heightened pressure. Camilo has shown potential in his earlier career and is recognized for a well-rounded skill set, but how he performs under UFC lights against an experienced fighter like Green remains uncertain.

Recent public sentiment shows that many analysts and fans lean towards Gabriel Green as the likely victor, primarily due to his grappling proficiency and experience within the UFC. While Camilo is viewed as an intriguing underdog with potential, the collective sentiment emphasizes Green’s fighting IQ and ability to control the fight dynamics. The betting odds reflect this sentiment, with Green positioned as an underdog at +170, which indicates that a portion of the betting market still favors him due to these considerations.

In conclusion, while there is an undercurrent of excitement regarding Camilo's future and possible surprise factors in this clash, Gabriel Green's established experience, grappling expertise, and current form lead me to predict that he will emerge victorious in this matchup, likely by submission or decision after controlling the fight through his superior grappling abilities. The fight is anticipated to be competitive, but Green holds a strategic advantage that could prove decisive.
