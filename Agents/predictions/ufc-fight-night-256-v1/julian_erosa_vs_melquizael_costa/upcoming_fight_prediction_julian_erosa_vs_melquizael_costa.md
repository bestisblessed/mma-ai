In the upcoming bout between Julian Erosa and Melquizael Costa, I predict that Julian Erosa will emerge victorious via submission in the later rounds of the fight. Here’s the reasoning behind this prediction:

1. **Experience and Fight Record**:
   Julian Erosa (31-11) has significant experience in mixed martial arts with 42 total fights, showcasing versatility through his 12 knockout victories and 14 submission wins. Although Erosa has faced challenges, with 7 losses by knockout, his fight IQ and adaptable grappling game are unique assets.

   In contrast, Melquizael Costa is relatively new to the professional fighting landscape, holding a record of 3-0. While he is undefeated, his experience gap could prove to be a disadvantage against a seasoned fighter like Erosa. Costa has demonstrated capability, winning 1 fight by submission and 2 by unanimous decision, but the training intensity and strategic decision-making needed in the octagon against a fighter of Erosa's caliber can be tough to navigate.

2. **Fighting Styles**:
   Erosa's ability to mix striking with grappling offers him a multi-faceted approach to the fight. His previous submissions, such as the Brabo choke and Guillotine choke, highlight his skill in exploiting positional advantages on the ground. Analysts expect him to utilize a D'Arce choke, which could be pivotal during the match, particularly in later rounds when Costa could be fatigued.

   Costa’s victories have predominantly come through decisions, indicating his capacity to push fights into deep waters. Nonetheless, Erosa’s unpredictable and high-paced fighting style could catch Costa off guard, especially if he is unable to impose his own game plan effectively.

3. **Public Sentiment and Betting Odds**:
   Public sentiment appears biased towards Costa, mainly due to his undefeated record and recent performances. Betting analysts indicate that 83% of bettors favor Costa at -200 odds, secure in his winning streak. Although a considerable portion of the betting community backs Costa, it's crucial to note that Erosa’s ability to thrive in high-pressure situations could lead to an upset.

   Erosa’s moneyline at +180 reflects value given his extensive experience and the potential for a submission finish (+400), which aligns with my prediction. The odds suggest that Erosa may be underestimated despite presenting a higher level of competitive experience.

4. **Fight Dynamics**:
   Erosa's eagerness to compete and quick turnaround after bouts reflect his commitment and readiness to face challenges head-on. This mindset, alongside his grappling prowess, means he could either catch Costa in a moment of overcommitment or capitalize on a late fatigue scenario, leading to a submission. In contrast, Costa's tactical but steady approach might work initially but could struggle to adapt if Erosa sets a fast pace.

In conclusion, despite the public's favoring of Costa, the experience and grappling acumen of Julian Erosa suggest a higher probability of success. I predict Erosa will secure a submission victory in the third round, utilizing his skills and seizing the opportunity as the fight progresses.
