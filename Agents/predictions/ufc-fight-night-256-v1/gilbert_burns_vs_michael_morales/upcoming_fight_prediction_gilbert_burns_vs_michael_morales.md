The upcoming fight between Gilbert Burns and Michael Morales presents an exciting clash of experience against youthful vigor. 

**Prediction: Michael Morales to Win by TKO in Round 2**

**Reasoning:**

1. **Fighter Profiles:**
   - **Gilbert Burns** has fought 30 times in his professional career, securing victories in 22 of those bouts, with 9 by submission and 6 by knockout. Known for his exceptional grappling skills and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu expertise, Burns has demonstrated the ability to finish fights on the ground or win by unanimous decision. However, at age 36, he may be reaching the later stages of his fighting career, which could play a role against a younger opponent like Morales.
  
   - **Michael Morales** stands undefeated at 17-0, with a notable capacity for striking, evidenced by 12 of his wins coming by way of knockout. His youthful energy and aggressive fighting style make him an imposing challenge for Burns.

2. **Striking and Grappling Stats:**
   - Burns has a significant strike landed per minute (SLpM) of 3.17 but absorbs slightly more strikes (3.57). His striking accuracy is 48%, and although he possesses substantial grappling abilities, he has a takedown defense rate of only 47%, raising concerns about his ability to withstand pressure against a striking-heavy opponent like Morales.
  
   - Morales, while lacking comprehensive statistical data like Burns, has showcased powerful, aggressive striking capabilities in his previous fights. His youth and athleticism render him a dangerous adversary especially considering his finishing rate.

3. **Public Sentiment and Betting Odds:**
   - Currently, the betting odds lean heavily in favor of Morales at -850, while Burns is positioned as a +575 underdog. This reflects a strong expectation for Morales to emerge victorious. The mixed public sentiment acknowledges Burns' skills but also emphasizes curiosity regarding Morales' potential breakout moment.

4. **Fight Dynamics:**
   - In the octagon, Burns will likely seek to employ his grappling to offset Moralesâ€™ striking prowess. However, Morales' striking must be respected as he possesses knockout power. It is also important to note that Burns has faced individuals with high finishing rates, but Morales' undefeated streak and combination of speed and power could lead to a TKO win.

Given all these aspects, I predict Michael Morales to finish the fight by TKO in the second round, making a strong statement against a seasoned veteran in Gilbert Burns. This outcome would not only enhance Morales' reputation but also ignite discussions about potential future title shots in the welterweight division.
