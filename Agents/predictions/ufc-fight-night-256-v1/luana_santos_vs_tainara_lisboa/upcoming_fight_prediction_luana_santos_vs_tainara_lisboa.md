The public sentiment is mixed but slightly leans toward Santos, largely due to her grappling credentials and recent performances where she effectively controlled the pace of her bouts.

**Prediction:**
Based on the analysis of fight records, fighting styles, strategies, public sentiment, and betting trends, I predict that Luana Santos is likely to win by submission. Her ability to secure takedowns and control the fight on the ground plays into her strengths effectively against Lisboa’s striking background. If Santos can engage Lisboa early and effectively disrupt her striking rhythm, she may successfully find opportunities for submissions as the fight progresses.

However, if Lisboa manages to keep the contest standing and uses her striking to wear Santos down, she could potentially secure a knockout victory or a decision win if it goes to later rounds. The fight promises excitement given both fighters' skills and attributes, and while Santos is my favored pick, it is essential to consider the unpredictability inherent in combat sports.
