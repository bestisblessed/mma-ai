**Fight Prediction: Gabriel Green vs. Matheus Camilo**

As we analyze the upcoming matchup between Gabriel Green (11-5) and Matheus Camilo (9-2), we must consider an array of factors including their fighting styles, records, recent performances, and public sentiment.

**Fighter Profiles:**
- **Gabriel Green ("Gifted")**: Known for his grappling ability, Green boasts a record of 11 wins, with 6 submissions and 4 KOs. Though he has faced setbacks, notably a 14-second knockout, his overall experience fighting at a higher level could potentially place him ahead of Camilo. Green's notable submission prowess, highlighted by his recent victory against Gabriel Benitez via technical submission, signifies his strength on the ground.
  
- **Matheus Camilo ("Jaguar")**: Camilo, with a record of 9 wins (4 KOs, 2 submissions), displays an aggressive striking style but is less experienced overall than Green. His recent submissions against lower-tier opponents suggest a strong grappling game; however, he hasn’t faced someone of Green’s caliber in the octagon yet.

**Recent Performances:**
Green’s stint includes a year gap, which could either be a disadvantage as he seeks to regain rhythm or an opportunity for strategic re-evaluation after adversity. Camilo, on the other hand, has shown significant improvement and an upward trajectory in performance, defeating tough opponents with submissions in his recent fights.

**Fight Style and Strategy:**
Both fighters have shown capability in finishing fights, with Green being adept in submissions and Camilo mixing striking with grappling. These contrasting styles present a compelling dynamic, where Green’s grappling-heavy approach may counter Camilo’s striking. The fight could turn in favor of Green if he successfully employs his wrestling and grappling during exchanges, while Camilo will aim to create striking opportunities on the feet.

**Public Sentiment and Betting Odds:**
Current public sentiment favors Green primarily due to his experience and past fight history, as seen in the betting landscape where Green is often viewed as an underdog (+150 to +170) while Camilo navigates a slight favorite role (-170 to -180). This suggests the betting community recognizes the potential for an upset, given Green’s skillset despite his layoff.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, I predict Gabriel Green to win this matchup against Matheus Camilo. The reasoning is grounded in Green’s extensive grappling experience, demonstrated ability to secure submissions against tough opponents, and an overall fight IQ that can capitalize on Camilo's weaknesses. If Green can withstand early aggression and manage to bring the fight to the ground, he will likely finish Camilo using his submission game, possibly securing a victory by submission. With Bet365 providing favorable odds for a Green win by submission (around +800), it indicates this outcome is seen as a viable path to victory.
