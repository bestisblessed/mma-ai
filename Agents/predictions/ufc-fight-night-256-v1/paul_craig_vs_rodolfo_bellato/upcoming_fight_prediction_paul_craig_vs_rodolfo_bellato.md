The fight between Paul Craig (17-9-1) and Rodolfo Bellato (12-2-1) is set to take place under the UFC banner. Both fighters have distinct styles, strengths, and weaknesses which will play a crucial role in determining the outcome of this matchup.

**Paul Craig:**
- **Strengths:** Craig is renowned for his Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu skills, with a staggering 13 of his 17 wins coming by way of submission. His grappling prowess allows him to be dangerous from both the standing position and while on the ground. His ability to pull off submission finishes, even against tougher opponents, showcases his skill set. Craig has experience in high-pressure situations and has shown resilience, often turning the tide in later rounds of fights.
  
- **Weaknesses:** Craig has recently struggled against opponents with strong striking power and has suffered five knockout losses throughout his career. His recent performance has displayed inconsistency, particularly in fights against high-tier competition. Craig's striking defense could be a potential liability against Bellato, who shows effective striking capabilities.

**Rodolfo Bellato:**
- **Strengths:** Bellato looks to be an emerging talent within the UFC, combining a strong arsenal of striking with effective grappling abilities. With 7 KOs in his 12 wins, his striking power is formidable, and he successfully finished his last fight via TKO, which has built significant momentum heading into this matchup. His ability to adapt during fights and capitalize on opportunities to finish is commendable.
  
- **Weaknesses:** Bellato's wrestling appears to be a weaker aspect of his game, evidenced by low takedown efficiency. While he is capable of grappling, he might underestimate Craig's submission awareness, leading to potential opportunities for Craig to exploit on the ground.

**Public Sentiment and Betting Odds:**
Public sentiment heavily favors Bellato going into this fight. Discussion on social media reflects excitement for his performance and a growing confidence in his abilities as a contender. The current betting odds further emphasize this sentiment, with Bellato favored at -550, while Craig sits at +400.

This indicates that bettors believe Bellato's striking power and recent form provide him a significant advantage over Craig's wrestling. Additionally, many analysts suggest that while Craig has a chance on the ground, Bellato's aggressive style and ability to finish fights make him a strong candidate to win.

### Conclusion:
The prediction for the upcoming fight between Paul Craig and Rodolfo Bellato is that Bellato will win, likely by TKO/KO or decision. Craig has the possibility to secure a submission if he can effectively maneuver to the ground, but considering the current trajectory of both fighters, Bellato's recent performances and perceived improvements position him as the stronger contender in this fight. 

Ultimately, if Craig can effectively mitigate Bellato's striking and bring the fight to the ground, he has a chance to finish the fight via submission, but this is a riskier approach given Bellato's substantial striking threats. The anticipated outcome is Bellato emerging victorious, solidifying his reputation as a rising star in the UFC light heavyweight division.
