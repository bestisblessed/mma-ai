      "\n",
      "### Dan Hooker\n",
      "Dan Hooker, known for his striking prowess, has an impressive record of 11 wins by KO. He has a notable height advantage (6'0\") which he frequently utilizes to maintain range and deliver powerful strikes. His well-rounded skills also include 7 victories by submission. However, his 12 losses indicate vulnerabilities, particularly with 3 losses coming via KO and 3 via submission.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Mateusz Gamrot\n",
      "Mateusz Gamrot, with his well-rounded fight game, holds an equally impressive record. With 11 wins by decision, 8 by KO, and 5 by submission, Gamrot demonstrates versatility and adaptability in the Octagon. His 2 losses, both by decision, suggest strong resilience and defense, as he has never been knocked out or submitted in his professional career.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prediction Insight\n",
      "Both fighters are in the lightweight category, implying compatibility in weight and agility. Hooker's striking power and reach advantage could pose significant challenges for Gamrot. Conversely, Gamrot's unyielding defense and ability to secure victories via various methods make him a formidable opponent.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential Outcome:**\n",
      "- **For Dan Hooker to Win:** Leverage his height and reach advantage to keep Gamrot at distance and utilize his striking to earn a KO victory.\n",
      "- **For Mateusz Gamrot to Win:** Employ a balanced approach, leveraging his strong defense to mitigate Hooker's striking threats and capitalize on any opening for a decision or submission victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "This match promises to be an exciting and tactical battle, showcasing the strengths and strategic depth of both fighters.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Submission Proficiency**:\n",
      "   - Although both fighters have fewer submission wins, Michael Page has a slightly better average submission fight duration (~2.59 minutes) compared to Ian Garry (~3.68 minutes). This suggests Page may have a slight edge when grappling or navigating vulnerable positions.\n",

      "1. **Finish Rate**: Michael Page demonstrates a higher KO/TKO finish rate (63.6%) compared to Ian Garry (50%). This suggests Page is more likely to end fights early via striking.\n",
      "2. **Fight Duration**: Page's KO/TKO finishes occur quicker on average (~2.04 minutes) than Garry’s (~3.30 minutes), indicating a more immediate impact in his fights.\n",
      "3. **Decision Wins**: While both fighters have a significant proportion of decision wins, Garry has a higher percentage (42.9% vs. 31.8%), showcasing his ability to go the distance and win on points.\n",

However, **Ian Garry’s** undefeated record, durability, and tactical approach in decision fights highlight his capability to withstand an aggressive opponent and secure wins over the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Prognosis\n",
      "While Michael Page's aggressive striking and experience may give him a slight edge, Ian Garry’s defensive resilience and flawless record could neutralize early aggression and exploit any mistakes over the bout. Given the detailed metrics, the outcome could lean towards Michael Page if he capitalizes on early striking opportunities, but Ian Garry remains a formidable contender capable of turning the tables.\n",
