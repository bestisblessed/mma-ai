      "\n",
      "2. **Recent Form**:\n",
      "   - Ian Garry has a stellar recent fight history with six consecutive victories in the UFC, showcasing his ability to win by both KO/TKO and decision.\n",
      "   - Michael Page has a recent loss by decision, indicating a potential drop in performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Win Methods**:\n",
      "   - Both fighters have a mix of KO/TKO and decision victories. Garry seems to have more recent finishes via KO/TKO, suggesting a high level of striking proficiency and power.\n",
      "   - Page also shows a strong propensity for knockouts, but with his recent loss, there might be questions about his current form.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Undefeated Streak**:\n",
      "   - Ian Garry's undefeated streak is significant as it indicates a higher confidence level and momentum coming into the fight.\n",

      "Ian Garry's recent form shows a dominant string of performances with multiple finishes and decisive victories. His ability to adapt and utilize effective striking techniques, coupled with his undefeated streak, positions him as the favorite. Michael Page, while experienced and capable, has shown vulnerabilities, particularly in his recent loss. Garry’s momentum, striking precision, and unwavering confidence will likely lead to a victory by TKO in the second round as he overwhelms Page with his striking prowess."

      "  - Michael Page: 65%\n",
      "  - Ian Garry: 70%\n",

      "\n",
      "### Fight Trends and Detailed Prediction:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Striking Proficiency**:\n",
      "   - Ian Garry’s higher striking accuracy and defense, combined with his ability to absorb fewer strikes per minute, suggest he will likely outstrike Michael Page. Garry's strikes are precise and frequent, which can disrupt Page’s rhythm and game plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Defensive Aptitude**:\n",
      "   - Both fighters have solid takedown defense, with Garry holding a slight edge. This means the fight is likely to remain standing, favoring Garry's precise striking.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Recent Performance**:\n",
      "   - Garry's undefeated streak and recent victories by KO/TKO highlight his current momentum and finishing ability. Page's recent loss indicates possible vulnerabilities that Garry could exploit.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Psychological Edge**:\n",
      "   - Undefeated records bring a psychological advantage, boosting Garry’s confidence. Page, despite his experience, may face heightened pressure having not rebounded recently from a loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Advanced Prediction:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Winner**: Ian Garry  \n",
      "**Method/Time of Victory**: KO/TKO in Round 3  \n",
      "**Detailed Explanation**: \n",
      "\n",
      "Ian Garry's statistical advantages in striking accuracy, defense, and overall better fight metrics suggest he will likely dominate the striking exchanges. His ability to effectively avoid and absorb strikes while maintaining high precision will allow him to accumulate damage on Michael Page over the rounds. Garry’s slightly better grappling metrics suggest he can also counter any potential takedown attempts from Page effectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given Garry’s recent performances and ability to finish fights, he is well-positioned to secure a TKO victory in the third round as he systematically breaks down Page, leveraging his superior striking precision and defensive capabilities."

      "   - Diego Lopes has more wins overall but has faced some losses, indicating both experience and some vulnerability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Recent Form**:\n",
      "   - Diego Lopes has shown diverse finishes in recent victories (KO/TKO and submission), displaying strong striking and submission skills.\n",
      "   - Brian Ortega's recent form includes multiple losses, although to high-caliber opponents. He also has a significant victory against Chan Sung Jung.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Striking Proficiency**:\n",
      "   - Diego Lopes seems to have effective striking capabilities, with recent KO/TKO wins.\n",
      "   - Brian Ortega’s striking has historically been less dangerous than his submission game. His losses by TKO also suggest he might be outmatched in striking exchanges.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Submission Skills**:\n",
      "   - Brian Ortega is renowned for his submission skills, with 8 submission wins. This is his most dangerous weapon.\n",
      "   - Diego Lopes also has a strong submission background, with 12 submission victories, but has shown more versatility in his win methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Defensive Metrics**:\n",
      "   - Ortega’s susceptibility to strikes, as seen in his recent losses, could be problematic against Lopes, who has shown proficiency in striking.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prediction:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Winner**: Diego Lopes  \n",
      "**Method/Time of Victory**: KO/TKO in Round 2  \n",
      "**Detailed Explanation**: \n",
      "\n",
      "Diego Lopes brings a balanced and dynamic skill set with recent victories showcasing both his striking and submission abilities. Brian Ortega, while having a potent submission game, has shown vulnerabilities in striking, suffering multiple losses by KO/TKO. Lopes’ striking precision and versatility suggest he will likely dominate the striking exchanges. Ortega's recent form and defensive deficiencies against skilled strikers play in Lopes' favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, I predict that Diego Lopes will secure a victory by TKO in the second round, utilizing his superior striking to overwhelm Ortega and avoid getting caught in submission attempts."
