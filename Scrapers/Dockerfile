# Running your `scraper.py` script from a Docker container on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) involves several steps. Below is a guide to help you set up and run your Python script in a Docker container.

# ### Step 1: Install Docker on Raspberry Pi
# If you haven't already installed Docker on your Raspberry Pi, you can do so with the following commands:

# 1. **Update your package list**:
#    ```bash
#    sudo apt update
#    ```

# 2. **Install Docker**:
#    ```bash
#    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
#    sh get-docker.sh
#    ```

# 3. **Add your user to the Docker group** (optional, allows running Docker without `sudo`):
#    ```bash
#    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
#    ```

# 4. **Log out and back in** to apply the group changes.

# ### Step 2: Create a Dockerfile
# Create a `Dockerfile` in the same directory as your `scraper.py` script. This file will define the environment for your Docker container.

# Hereâ€™s an example `Dockerfile`:

# ```dockerfile
# # Use the official Python image for ARM architecture
# FROM arm32v7/python:3.12-slim

# # Set the working directory
# WORKDIR /app

# # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
# COPY . .

# # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
# RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# # Run scraper.py when the container launches
# CMD ["python", "scraper.py"]
# ```

# ### Step 3: Create a requirements.txt File
# If your `scraper.py` script has dependencies (like `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, etc.), create a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory with the necessary packages:

# ```plaintext
# requests
# beautifulsoup4
# pandas
# tqdm
# ```

# ### Step 4: Build the Docker Image
# Navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile` and `scraper.py`, then build the Docker image:

# ```bash
# docker build -t my-scraper .
# ```

# ### Step 5: Run the Docker Container
# After building the image, you can run the container:

# ```bash
# docker run --rm my-scraper
# ```

# ### Step 6: (Optional) Mount a Volume
# If you want to save the output files generated by your scraper to your Raspberry Pi's filesystem, you can mount a volume:

# ```bash
# docker run --rm -v /path/to/local/data:/app/data my-scraper
# ```

# Replace `/path/to/local/data` with the path on your Raspberry Pi where you want to store the output files.

# ### Summary
# 1. Install Docker on your Raspberry Pi.
# 2. Create a `Dockerfile` and a `requirements.txt` file.
# 3. Build the Docker image.
# 4. Run the Docker container.

# This setup will allow you to run your `scraper.py` script in a Docker container on your Raspberry Pi. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
